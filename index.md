Last Updated: September 27, 2025

Thank you for using ReadyUpCoach. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the ReadyUpCoach application for iOS.

1. Data Collection and Storage

ReadyUpCoach is designed with your privacy in mind. All data you enter into the app is stored exclusively on your local device. We, the developers of ReadyUpCoach, do not have access to, collect, or store any of the information you input into the app.

The types of data you can store in the app include:

Player Information: Name, jersey number, preferred positions, availability status, and photos you choose to add from your photo library.

Sensitive Player Information (Optional): You may optionally add emergency contact information and medical notes for players. This information is also stored only on your device and is intended for your reference as the coach.

Game and Team Data: Scheduled games, opponents, locations, game statistics (like scores, goals, and assists), and player lineups are all stored locally.

2. Data Usage

The data you enter is used solely for the functionality of the ReadyUpCoach app, which includes:

Managing your team roster.

Scheduling games and tracking your season.

Planning formations and lineups for games.

Tracking in-game statistics and player performance, such as playing time, goals, and assists.

Viewing post-game summaries and statistics.

Since all data is stored locally, it is not used for any other purpose, such as advertising, analytics, or tracking, by the developers.

3. Data Deletion

You are in complete control of your data. You can delete individual players from your roster or scheduled games at any time within the app. You can also delete all data and reset the app to its initial state using the "Reset All Data" option in the settings.

4. Children's Privacy

ReadyUpCoach is an app for youth soccer coaches. While the app stores information about children (the players), this data is entered by and stored on the device of the coach or parent using the app. We do not collect or have access to this information. It is the responsibility of the app user to ensure they have the necessary consent from parents or guardians to store this information on their personal device.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on our App Store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
